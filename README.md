# gadmin
`gadmin` solves the boring problem of building an admin interface on top of an existing data model. With little effort, it lets you manage your web serviceâ€™s data through a user-friendly interface.

## How does it work?
The basic concept behind `gadmin`, is that it lets you build complicated interfaces by grouping individual views together in classes: Each web page you see on the frontend, represents a method on a class that has explicitly been added to the interface.

We write `gadmin` in Go, depend on `net/http`, `template/html` and `gorm`.

## Example
```go
mv := gadmin.NewModelView(User{}).
    SetColumnList("type", "first_name", "last_name", "email", "ip_address", "currency", "timezone", "phone_number").
    SetColumnEditableList("first_name", "type", "currency", "timezone").
    SetColumnDescriptions(map[string]string{"first_name": "First Name"}).
    SetCanSetPageSize(true).
    SetPageSize(5).
    SetTablePrefixHtml(`<h4>Some Caution</h4>`)
admin.AddView(mv)
```

# Flask-Admin
`Flask-Admin` inspires this project. We copy the template files from flask-admin(bootstrap4 only).
